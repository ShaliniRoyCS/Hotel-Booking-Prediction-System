Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
Overview
This project aims to develop an understandable and validated predictive model for hotel booking cancellations. The goal is to accurately predict when a booking will be canceled while also identifying the key factors that influence the likelihood of cancellation. The client, a large hotel operator, has provided data from two representative hotels (a resort and a city property) to train and evaluate the model.
