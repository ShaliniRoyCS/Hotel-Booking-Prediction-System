# Hotel Booking Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to develop an understandable and validated predictive model for hotel booking cancellations. The goal is to accurately predict when a booking will be canceled while also identifying the key factors that influence the likelihood of cancellation. The client, a large hotel operator, has provided data from two representative hotels (a resort and a city property) to train and evaluate the model.

## Data
The dataset provided by the hotel operator contains booking information from their resort and city properties. It includes various features such as booking dates, lead time, length of stay, deposit type, customer type, and more. Extensive exploratory data analysis was performed to validate the data and identify potential issues or unreasonable values.

## Modeling Approach
Several machine learning models were explored and evaluated, including:

Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

After rigorous evaluation and validation, a Random Forest model was selected as the final model due to its superior performance and interpretability.
